/**
 * Read-Write Lock
 * @description
 * Think of Read-Write Lock as a smart access control system for shared data.
 * The main idea is that we can have multiple readers accessing data simultaneously (because reading doesnâ€™t change anything),
 * but only one writer can modify the data at a time, and no one should be reading while writing is happening.
